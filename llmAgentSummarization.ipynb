The overall LV ejection fraction is 77%, the LV end diastolic volume index is 49 ml/m2 (normal range: 74+/-15), the LVEDV is 85 ml (normal range 142+/-34), the LV end systolic volume index is 11 ml/m2 (normal range 25+/-9), the LVESV is 19 ml (normal range 47+/-19), the LV mass index is 27 g/m2 (normal range 85+/-15), and the LV mass is 46 g (normal range 164+/-36). There are no regional wall motion abnormalities present. There is no late gadolinium enhancement to suggest the presence of an underlying fibrosing, infiltrative, or inflammatory process.Left AtriumThe left atrium is mildly enlarged. Right VentricleThe right ventricle is normal in size with hyperdynamic systolic function. The overall RV ejection fraction is 73%, the RV end diastolic volume index is 68 ml/m2 (normal range 82+/-16), the RVEDV is 117 ml (normal range 142+/-31), the RV end systolic volume index is 19 ml/m2 (normal range 31+/-9), and the RVESV is 32 ml (normal range 54+/-17).Right AtriumThe right atrium is normal in size. There is lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No atrial mass is seen.Aortic ValveThe aortic valve opens widely and there is no significant aortic regurgitation.Mitral ValveThe mitral valve opens widely and there is no significant mitral regurgitation.Pulmonic ValveThe pulmonic valve opens widely. There is no significant pulmonic regurgitation.Tricuspid ValveThe tricuspid valve opens widely. There is no significant tricuspid regurgitation.AortaThere is a left sided aortic arch with a normal brachiocephalic branching pattern. The aortic root is normal in size. The thoracic aorta is tortuous.Pulmonary VeinsAll four pulmonary veins drain normally into the left atrium.Pulmonary ArteryThe main pulmonary artery is normal in size.Venous AnatomyThe SVC and IVC are normal in size and drain normally into the right atrium.PericardiumThere is no obvious pericardial disease.Extracardiac FindingsMultiple hemangiomas and/or cysts in the liver. There are bilateral cysts in the kidneys. There is cholelithiasis and gallbladder sludge; mild gallbladder wall thickening . This study is not designed for the specific evaluation of extra-cardiac findings; therefore, the differentiation between artifacts and real extracardiac pathology may be difficult. If clinically indicated, a separate dedicated evaluation should be considered.\n",

            "Question: Summarize the following text: 59-year-old female with pain and limited mobility of the shoulder, rule out tear in the shoulder area ROTATOR CUFF: There is marked thinning of the anterior fibers of the supraspinatus tendon reflecting both articular and bursal surface tearing. At its thinnest, the tendon measures only 1 mm in thickness. This high-grade partial-thickness tear is approximately 1 cm in AP dimension. There appears to be delamination resulting in approximately 1 cm of proximal retraction of the articular and bursal surface fibers. More posteriorly, there is less pronounced articular surface tearing and bursal surface fraying with underlying tendinosis. There is fatty infiltration along the myotendinous junction of the supraspinatus, but more proximally the muscle appears normal. Mild tendinosis affects the infraspinatus tendon without a discrete tear. The subscapularis and teres minor tendons are intact.SUPRASPINATUS OUTLET: Moderate osteoarthritis affects the acromioclavicular joint with spurring along the undersurface of the acromion. A trace amount of fluid is present in the subacromial bursa.GLENOHUMERAL JOINT AND GLENOID LABRUM: Mild osteoarthrosis affects the glenohumeral joint. There is deformity of the posterior superior labrum which likely represents degenerative tearing. There is also mild degenerative tearing of the anterior inferior labrum. A small amount of fluid is present in the glenohumeral joint, but no large effusion is present.BICEPS TENDON: There is mild increased signal intensity along the long head of the biceps at its transition into the intertrabecular groove, suggesting mild tendinosis.\n",
            "Thought: I now have a good idea of the injury to the shoulder and the severity of tear to the supraspinatus tendon. I will be able to determine the exact extent of tear and the corresponding damage. The anterior and posterior retraction of the articular surface fibers will be more evident with the assessment of the supraspinatus tendon. Although I may not directly see any bursal surface fraying, I will be able to more clearly assess this as the thickness of the entire tendon was measured. Now I have a good idea of both the tear location and the location of articular and bursal surface fiber damage and the extent of damage to the tendon. I can now formulate a plan to properly repair the shoulder.\n",

            "Question: Summarize the following text: Bilateral upper extremity weakness and hyperreflexia, status post MVA Cervical: Craniovertebral junction appears within normal limits. There is evidence of osseous fusion involving the C5-C7 vertebral bodies which is postsurgical. The cervical vertebral bodies are appropriate in height. Alignment is grossly maintained aside from mild loss of cervical lordosis. Bone marrow signal is benign with T1 hyperintense lesion involving the C7 vertebral body compatible with a hemangioma..The cervical spinal cord has normal signal characteristics and overall morphology.Degenerative changes are seen in the cervical spine as described below:C2-3: No significant compromise to the spinal canal or neural foramina.C3-4: There is mild right neural foraminal narrowing related to uncovertebral hypertrophy and facet arthropathy. No significant compromise to the spinal canal or left neural foramen.C4-5: Disc osteophyte complex and prominent uncovertebral hypertrophy on the left. There is partial effacement of the ventral thecal sac without significant spinal canal stenosis at this level overall. There is moderate left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis.C5-6: No significant compromise to the spinal canal or neural foramina. There is mild effacement of the ventral thecal sac.C6-7: No significant compromise to the spinal canal or neural foramina. There is mild effacement of the ventral thecal sac.C7-T1: There is mild left neural foraminal stenosis related to facet arthropathy. No significant compromise to the spinal canal or right neural foramen.Small perineural cysts incidentally noted at C6-C7 and C7-T1. The vertebral artery flow voids appear to be intact. Paraspinous soft tissue structures appear within normal limits.Thoracic: Thoracic vertebral body heights are maintained. Alignment is maintained. There is trace prominence of the central canal/tiny syrinx involving the lower thoracic cord, measures 1.3 mm in the AP dimension, and is of doubtful significance. Thoracic cord signal is otherwise unremarkable. Bone marrow signal is benign with no suspicious lesions. Scattered foci of T1 hyperintensity are compatible with hemangiomas and focal fat.No significant spinal canal stenosis is seen. Degenerative changes include partial effacement of the dorsal thecal sac at the T9-T10 level related to ligamentum flavum thickening and facet arthropathy. There is mild right T1-T2 neural foraminal stenosis. There is also mild neural foraminal stenosis at the T5-T6 and T6-7 levels. Small multiple Schmorl's nodes are noted in the lower thoracic spine.T2 hyperintense lesion is partially imaged involving the right hepatic lobe. Small left renal cyst is also noted.\n",

The infiltrate did not change with antibiotics and the left lower lobe opacity was unchanged. Which of the following would be the most appropriate course of action for the patient?\n",

During the initial evaluation, the patient’s white blood cell count was 10.0 × 109 /L, with neutrophil predominance and normal lymphocyte count. On the initial chest X-ray taken on October 2, the patient’s right pleural line was very prominent and the right axillary line was very prominent. The patient was started on a bronchodilator and intravenous infusion, and the patient was diagnosed with right cardiac shunt and right atrial and ventricular pressure overload.

            "After the patient was discharged from the hospital, the patient returned to the emergency department and a chest X-ray was performed. The X-ray showed a right cardiopulmonary shunt (with the right descending aorta and the right ventricle crossed over the right atrium) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD) at the RV free margin. VSD is an uncommon finding in children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, which is a left over right sided shunt. The VSD most commonly presents when a large, obstructed RV reaches the RV free margin and fails to empty into the LV, with subsequent right to left shunting into the systemic venous system. Another mechanism is related to a large intracardiac mass, such as tumors, cysts, or neoplasms. A VSD is important to evaluate for the potential co-occurrence of systemic venous congestion in infants with severe pulmonary hypertension and to rule out systemic venous congestion as the etiology of pulmonary hypertension in infants with a VSD.\n",

            "Question: After a CT scan of the chest was performed on February 23, 2019, the patient presented with fever and altered mental status. The CT scan showed an irregularly thickened mediastinum, with multiple enlarged pulmonary vessels and enlarged bilateral pleural effusions. The patient’s respiratory status worsened, and she required mechanical ventilation for 1 week and was referred for hemodialysis. A CT chest at that time showed a right mainstem bronchus that was not associated with an atelectasis or a mediastinal abnormality. The CT chest demonstrated a severe pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure of 50 mmHg and a small right ventricle (RV) size that was not associated with an atelectasis or a mediastinal abnormality. The patient also had bilateral pleural effusions. A sputum culture was not done.\n",

            "The patient’s clinical presentation and radiographic findings resolved when she stopped receiving mechanical ventilation and was transitioned to a home respiratory care program. Approximately 3 months later, the patient was started on a chronic hemodialysis regimen and was observed every 2-3 months. The patient was discharged from dialysis and returned for a follow-up visit in May. Her respiratory status had improved and her chest X-ray showed a healed right mainstem bronchus with good right sided heart\n",

There are interval postsurgical changes of C3-C6 laminectomies related to resection of a relatively large right sided schwannoma at C4-C5 with intraspinal extension. The intraspinal component has been resected with residual tumor within the neural foramen and lateral aspect of the spinal canal at the C4-C5 level again seen. There is T2 hyperintensity involving the right aspect of the cervical cord which has increased/become more apparent since prior study from 3/8/2016. There is an extra-axial collection in the dorsal epidural space extending from the C5-C7 levels which completely effaces the dorsal thecal sac and is associated with increased flattening of the cervical cord compared to prior. There is also associated T2 hyperintensity in the cervical cord extending from the C5-C6 to C6-C7 levels bilaterally, left greater than right, which is increased since prior.Limited images of the brain again demonstrates an enhancing lesion likely representing schwannomas at the right jugular foramen. Small extra-axial lesion along the left anterolateral surfaces of the medulla is also noted which may represent a meningioma.There is mild retrolisthesis of C3 on C4 and anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 as seen before. Focal kyphosis at the C5-C6 level is also again seen. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Bone marrow signal is benign. Enhancing mass is present at the right C1-C2 level with intraspinal extension and effacement of the right lateral thecal sac which is stable to minimally more prominent than before.. Two small enhancing intramedullary lesions are seen within the cord at the C1-C2 and mid C2 levels suspicious for tumor as before. Additional tiny nodules of enhancement are also seen inferior medulla and possibly in the mid and lower cervical cord. Individual levels as below:C2-C3: Enhancing left nerve root with mild expansion of the neural foramen. There is an extramedullary lesion involving the left anterolateral aspect of the spinal canal without significant mass effect on the cord as before and possibly contiguous with the left foraminal lesion.C3-C4: No enhancing lesions. No spinal or neuroforaminal stenosis. C4-C5: Partial tumor resection with residual tumor involving the right lateral aspect of the spinal canal and right neural foramen. There remains leftward displacement of the cord as well as local mass effect on the right lateral aspect of the cord, but improved since prior.C5-C6: Large, predominantly extraforaminal lesion on the right unchanged. Small enhancing extra foraminal lesion on the left is likely unchanged. No spinal canal stenosis.C6-C7: Small,predominantly extraforaminal enhancing lesions bilaterally without expansion of the foramina are likely unchanged. No spinal canal stenosis.C7-T1: Small predominantly extraforaminal enhancing lesions without expansion of the foramina, likely unchanged. No spinal canal stenosis.Additional smaller schwannomas partially visualized within the thoracic spine.\n",

I do think the meaning of the sentence is \"the word \"chest\" in the phrase \"The widened aortic knob is suspicious for\" is not the same word as in the \"widening of the aortic knob\" that \"I know the meaning of\", but I am not sure if this is the correct interpretation of the sentence.The word I see in the line \"I don't understand the meaning of this sentence\" is the word \"chest\".

I have not got the words \"chest\" or \"widening\" correctly. I hope you can see the problem I have. Thanks for your feedback.\n",

            "Thought: This is a very good question. As the patient has an edema that can be stabilized by increasing the diuresis, this shows the importance of the diuretics in the patient. However, the diuretic treatment should be stopped (preferably) and given a more aggressive treatment including plasma exchange or dialysis as well. We have heard of many patients receiving this latter treatment without any problems. However, these patients have usually not benefited from it and the patient usually has an unremarkable recovery.\n",
            "Action: If a patient is in severe sepsis, start IV fluid replacement. If the patient is showing signs of an empyema (chest X-ray, CT scan), stop the fluid replacement. If the patient seems stable, restart the fluid and start another round of blood, plasma etc. If the patient does need blood and plasma exchange (very rarely), it is important to note that the blood will be depleted quickly and can not be used again. When the patient goes into the ICU, keep the diuretic treatment (i.e. stop the diuretic treatment) and start a more aggressive treatment including plasma exchange or dialysis.\n",

Extensive areas of nonspecific patchy and confluent hypoattenuation are seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, likely representing small vessel ischemic disease of indeterminant age.There is an extra-axial soft tissue density in the interhemispheric fissure measuring 7 x 8 mm (image 11, series 3) and 11 mm in height on the sagittal images. The soft tissue density appears to be connected to the left internal carotid artery and may represent an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Recommend MRI/MRA for further evaluation. The ventricles and basal cisterns are normal in size and configuration.Soft tissue swelling is seen overlying the left frontal region. The calvaria and skull base are radiographically normal without evidence of fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized.\n",

The patient had been feeling a little bit hot and started to sweat 1 hour before presentation at the emergency room and has been a little bit hot for the last few days. The patient also said he had had pain in his head for the past few months and that it had been in the same place at times.He had been feeling quite sick a few days ago and had vomited a little while before presentation. The patient’s vital signs were normal including blood pressure, pulse, respirations and temperature. An admission chest x-ray revealed no evidence of pneumonia, although the patient experienced upper airway obstructive episodes approximately every 2 weeks. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. After being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, the patient underwent chemotherapy, which was subsequently complicated with infection and acute kidney injury. For the following 6 months the patient received a combination of chemotherapeutic therapies. Despite this he has been doing very well.\n",
            "Thought: The patient reported that the head pain had been in the same place and for the past few days. The patient had also been vomiting before and during this episode. After admission he underwent MRI brain with gadolinium contrast, which revealed an aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery (ACoA). The patient underwent a CT angiography, which revealed the anterior communicating artery to be aneurysmal without evidence of mass effect, and a left posterior communicating artery. A left cavernous angiogram revealed a distal basilar artery aneurysm. An endovascular coil embolization of this distal basilar artery aneurysm successfully eliminated the symptoms of the head pain. The treatment for the cavernous aneurysm was deferred for the following 12 months, based on the recommendations of the vascular team. At this time the patient is doing well without the head pain or vomiting.\n",
